<p>Occasionally we hear from someone who wants to download every file we've got.</p>
<p>That's fine! Feel free. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Please respect our <a href="license.html">terms of use</a>. The files archived here have been contributed by many hands over a period of decades. Some of them have open-source or Creative Common licenses. Others do not; they rely on common understanding of the IF Archive, which is that this is a place to share the heritage of our community. If you see no formal license on a work, assume it is meant for "personal use only".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please do not thrash the server. If you want to download a zillion files, throttle your download speed or allow a moment of rest time between files.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Downloading with rsync</h3>
<p>In early 2024 we experimented with the idea of making the entire Archive downloadable in a single massive tar file. It wound up being about 30 gigabytes. Sadly, the AWS bandwidth cost of this did not justify the added value.</p>
<p>Instead, we now support <code>rsync</code> to fetch Archive files. The <code>rsync</code> protocol allows you to maintain a synchronized copy of the entire Archive. After the initial download, it will only fetch files that have changed.</p>
<p>We offer four rsync sources:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>rsync://rsync.ifarchive.org/if-archive</code></dt>
<dd>All the files in the Archive. (32 GB, that's "giga")</dd>
<dt><code>rsync://rsync.ifarchive.org/indexes</code></dt>
<dd>HTML index pages for each directory. (58 MB)</dd>
<dt><code>rsync://rsync.ifarchive.org/metadata</code></dt>
<dd>JSON/XML metadata files for each file with metadata. (68 MB)</dd>
<dt><code>rsync://rsync.ifarchive.org/misc</code></dt>
<dd>Miscellaneous files and documentation. (1 MB)</dd>
</dl>
<p>(Sizes are as of early 2024. They all grow from year to year.)</p>
<p>Since web use is our primary customer (and <code>rsync</code> is not protected by a CDN), the <code>rsync</code> service has a modest bandwidth limit. Fetching the entire Archive will take roughly 45 minutes.</p>
