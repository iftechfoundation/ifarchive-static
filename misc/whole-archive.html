<p>Occasionally we hear from someone who wants to download every file we've got.</p>
<p>That's fine! Feel free. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Please respect our <a href="license.html">terms of use</a>. The files archived here have been contributed by many hands over a period of decades. Some of them have open-source or Creative Common licenses. Others do not; they rely on common understanding of the IF Archive, which is that this is a place to share the heritage of our community. If you see no formal license on a work, assume it is meant for "personal use only".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please do not thrash the server. If you want to download a zillion files, throttle your download speed or allow a moment of rest time between files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Single-file download</h3>
<p>In early 2024 we experimented with the idea of making the entire Archive downloadable in a single massive tar file. It wound up being about 30 gigabytes.</p>
<p>Sadly, the AWS bandwidth cost of this did not justify the added value. We are now considering other options, such as <code>rsync</code>.</p>
