<p>Occasionally we hear from someone who wants to download every file we've got.</p>
<p>That's fine! Feel free. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Please respect our <a href="license.html">terms of use</a>. The files archived here have been contributed by many hands over a period of decades. Some of them have open-source or Creative Common licenses. Others do not; they rely on common understanding of the IF Archive, which is that this is a place to share the heritage of our community. If you see no formal license on a work, assume it is meant for "personal use only".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please do not thrash the server. If you want to download a zillion files, throttle your download speed or allow a moment of rest time between files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Single-file download</h3>
<p>If you want to download everything in a single massive chunk, try this URL:</p>
<p><em>(30 gigabyte download; updated weekly.)</em></p>
<pre><code>https://iftf-ifarchive-download.s3.amazonaws.com/ifarchive-all.tar.gz
</code></pre>
<p>That's not a hyperlink because, seriously, you don't want to click on a 30-gigabyte link by accident. If you're serious about getting it, copy and paste that URL into your browser bar.</p>
