<h3>History</h3>

<p>
The IF Archive was founded in 1992 by Volker Blasius at the Gesellschaft fuer Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung mbH Bonn. It was originally an FTP server running at <code>ftp.gmd.de</code>.
</p>

<p>
FTP mirrors soon appeared in the US and elsewhere. In 1999, Andrew Plotkin and Paul Mazaitis brought the IF Archive to the World Wide Web at <code>ifarchive.org</code>. This was originally just a mirror, but when GMD was shut down in 2001, the <code>ifarchive.org</code> site took over as the Archive primary server.
</p>

<p>
The Archive was hosted at Carnegie Mellon University for many years. In 2014, Mark Musante volunteered to take over the hosting. Then in 2017 Mark suggested that <a href="http://blog.iftechfoundation.org/2017-06-30-iftf-is-adopting-the-if-archive.html">IFTF adopt the Archive</a>. That work is now complete &#x2014; and here we are.
</p>
