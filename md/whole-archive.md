title: Downloading the entire IF Archive
changedate: February 18, 2024

Occasionally we hear from someone who wants to download every file we've got.

That's fine! Feel free. However:

- Please respect our [terms of use](license.html). The files archived here have been contributed by many hands over a period of decades. Some of them have open-source or Creative Common licenses. Others do not; they rely on common understanding of the IF Archive, which is that this is a place to share the heritage of our community. If you see no formal license on a work, assume it is meant for "personal use only".

- Please do not thrash the server. If you want to download a zillion files, throttle your download speed or allow a moment of rest time between files.

### Single-file download

If you want to download everything in a single massive chunk, try this URL:

*(30 gigabyte download; updated weekly.)*

```
https://iftf-ifarchive-download.s3.amazonaws.com/ifarchive-all.tar.gz
```

That's not a hyperlink because, seriously, you don't want to click on a 30-gigabyte link by accident. If you're serious about getting it, copy and paste that URL into your browser bar.
