title: Downloading the entire IF Archive
changedate: April 3, 2024

Occasionally we hear from someone who wants to download every file we've got.

That's fine! Feel free. However:

- Please respect our [terms of use](license.html). The files archived here have been contributed by many hands over a period of decades. Some of them have open-source or Creative Common licenses. Others do not; they rely on common understanding of the IF Archive, which is that this is a place to share the heritage of our community. If you see no formal license on a work, assume it is meant for "personal use only".

- Please do not thrash the server. If you want to download a zillion files, throttle your download speed or allow a moment of rest time between files.

### Single-file download

In early 2024 we experimented with the idea of making the entire Archive downloadable in a single massive tar file. It wound up being about 30 gigabytes.

Sadly, the AWS bandwidth cost of this did not justify the added value. We are now considering other options, such as `rsync`.
